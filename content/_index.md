# Home

Hi, I'm Mohammed Salman. I'm a computer science graduate from [UITC](https://uoitc.edu.iq/), and I'm currently working on my startup. This site is a place to gather information about me, and to post some of my thoughts.

## Current Work

My final year project at UITC, conducted in collaboration with Coda, involved developing a system
for managing scientific departments. This project was successful, and since then I branched the system out to incorporate an E-Learning platform to be used by schools all over Iraq and potentially international schools as well.

The current iteration of the system is written in [Go](https://golang.org) -- my language of choice at the
moment. The admin dashboard is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the main mobile application is written using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

## Technical Interests

Nowadays, my main interest is in designing systems and writing back-end code. When doing this, I enjoy working
in the terminal using `vim`, `tmux` and `zsh` (my dotfiles can be found 
[here](https://github.com/msal4/dotfiles)). The languages I'm most comfortable in are Go, TypeScript and Dart.

## More Information

You can find more information about me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/4msal/) and my
